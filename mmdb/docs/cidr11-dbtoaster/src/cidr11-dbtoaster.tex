\begin{abstract}
This paper calls for a new breed of lightweight systems which
we call {\em dynamic data management systems (DDMS)}\/.
In a nutshell,
a DDMS manages (very large) {\em dynamic data structures}\/ with 
{\em agile, frequently fresh views}\/, and a facility for monitoring
these views and triggering application-level events.
%
We motivate DDMS with applications in large-scale data analytics
including data warehousing and high-frequency algorithmic trading
and compare them to more traditional data management systems 
architectures.
%such as DBMS and data stream processors.
%
We describe the DBToaster project, which is an ongoing effort to
develop a prototype DDMS system. We describe its architecture
design, techniques for high-frequency incremental view maintenance,
query optimization, storage, scaling up by parallelization, and
the various key challenges to overcome to make DDMS a reality.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
\tinysection{Implementation plan}
We are building an open-source DDMS as a collaboration between EPFL and Johns
Hopkins. We plan to construct a \textit{database generator}, a compilation tool
that builds specialized continuous query engines on top of our own open-source
main-memory query processing library. We have found there are surprisingly few
modern, modular, main-memory implementations available, with the exception of
Java-based engines such as HSQLDB, H2, etc. We perceive many opportunities for
innovation in main-memory engines by tapping into functional programming
techniques as briefly described in Section~\ref{sec:compilation}. We also hope
that such a library will valuable in an educational context, and will make extensive use
of the framework in our courses.
