\begin{abstract}
This paper calls for a new breed of lightweight systems --
{\em dynamic data management systems (DDMS)}\/.
In a nutshell,
a DDMS manages large {\em dynamic data structures}\/ with 
{\em agile, frequently fresh views}\/, and a facility for monitoring
these views and triggering application-level events.
%
We motivate DDMS with applications in large-scale data analytics
including data warehousing and high-frequency algorithmic trading
and compare them to more traditional data management systems 
architectures.
%such as DBMS and data stream processors.
%
We describe the DBToaster project, which is an ongoing effort to
develop a prototype DDMS system. We describe its architecture
design, techniques for high-frequency incremental view maintenance,
storage, scaling up by parallelization, and
the various key challenges to overcome to make DDMS a reality.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
We proposed a model for a Dynamic Data Management System based on the DBToaster
project, that argues for the need to revisit how large data management systems
handle high-volume updates. The project argues for several design choices: the
use of views as the primary entity in the system, the treatment ofviews as data structures, maintenance of these views through precompiled,\textit{parameterized} transitions, and simple application interactionthrough data structures. 
\tinysection{Implementation plan}
We are building an open-source DDMS as a collaboration between EPFL and Johns
Hopkins.
DBToaster was initiated while the authors were in the Cornell Database
Group~\cite{ahmad-vldb:09}, producing an initial version of a
transition compiler. Current ongoing directions include: i) leveraging
structural recursion to build a main-memory query processing library based on
functional programming techniques (see Section~\ref{sec:compilation}); ii)
parallelization, deployment and experimentation of a continuous analytics engine
in a cloud environment; iii) analysing the benefits of our execution model in a
batch operating mode on top of map-reduce.
