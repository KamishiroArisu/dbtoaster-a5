\section{Conclusions and Future Work}


\begin{itemize}
\item
Programming language theory paper: how to compile SQL to use user-specified
data structures.

\item
Compiling down more general declarative languages, with operators and
aggregates whose semantics is definable in the framework. Applications e.g.\
probabilistic inference in graphical models. Compile the graph structure
of the graphical model and the inference algorithms (using e.g.\ mesage
passing techniques) into C code. The data to be processed are the factor
relations/conditional probability tables.

\item
Compiling database applications and the database server together into a single
program that runs robustly and requires no administration. I.e., combine
our query compilation work with automatic administration ideas, if any of
this is actually needed.
\end{itemize}
