\section{System Overview}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \compiler\ compiles SQL down to C code, and this compiler is the main
  focus of this paper.
  \item For scalability and availability reasons, we foresee implementing a
  lightweight runtime consisting of the following additional components. This
  runtime will still execute C-code for individual queries. The components
  include:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Query loader and unloader, catalog and code shipping.
    \item Query scheduler and optimizer for both multi-core and distributed
    operation. Optimization mechanism examples include automated data structure
    partitioning and load balancing, as well as dynamic data structure sharing.
    \item Storage and recovery manager
    \item Network and deployment manager, with a declarative deployment
    definition language.
    \item Concurrency control model? e.g. single point of entry, or
    multiple w/ update propagation? Generate C-code w/ transactional memory
    primitives?
  \end{enumerate}
