The following flags may be passed in as arguments to Util.Debug.activate or
via dbtoaster's -d argument

ARGS: Print all arguments received. (Driver.ml)

CALCULUS: Regardless of the language specification, the calculus 
          representation of the parsed input will be printed. (Driver.ml)

COMPILE-WITH-GDB: Ocaml-generated code is compiled with the -g flag, causing
                  debugging information to be compiled in.  This is required for 
                  backtraces and gdb debugging (Driver.ml)

DISABLE-DELETES: Do not generate M3 deletion triggers. (Compiler.ml / 
                 CalcToM3.ml)

IGNORE-DUP-MAPS: Disable postprocessor duplicate map detection.  Distinct
                 maps that happen to represent the same query will not be 
                 eliminated.  Note that the compiler will still not produce 
                 duplicate instances of the same map. (CalcToM3.ml)

M3: If the language is not 'calc', the M3 delta representation of the parsed 
    input will be printed. (Driver.ml)

MAP-CALC: Each map's calculus query representation will be printed (along
          with a note if it has been replaced by an equivalent map) 
          (CalcToM3.ml)

MAP-DELTAS: Print the calculus and M3 representations of each delta. 
            (CalcToM3.ml)

PARSE: If Parsing fails, a parser backtrace will be printed. (Driver.ml)
