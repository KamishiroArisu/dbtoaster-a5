This is the SPREAD query compiler.

For examples of its use see CompilerTest.ml.


TODOs:

* The output has be be formatted in a way convenient to Oliver.

* The code still has to be cleaned up and better documented, particularly
  MapAlg.ml and Compiler.ml.

* The code does not generate partition hints yet.


Recent changes:

* Inequality constraints and self-joins now work.

* RelAlg and MapAlg have been merged into Algebra. MapAlg expressions are
  now called terms. AtomicConstraints are over terms, so relalg_t and
  term_t are mutually recursive.

* Types now supported.
