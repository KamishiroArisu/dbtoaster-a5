This is the SPREAD query compiler.

TODOs/known bugs:

* RelAlg.extract_substitutions has to be generalized so that we can support
  self-joins. This means that sometimes we cannot eliminate equality
  constraints but has to keep them around as if-conditions in the generated
  code.

* Inequality constraints basically work (there is no special type for
  if-comditions, but we can represent them as non-relational relational
  algebra), but the code generator does not generate if statements yet.

* The output has be be formatted in a way convenient to Oliver.

* The code still has to be cleaned up and better documented, particularly
  MapAlg.ml and Compiler.ml.

* The code does not generate partition hints yet.
