This is Christoph's shot at the query compiler.

Recent changes:

* Nested aggregates are supported, but we have to provide, as part of the
  input to the compiler, the list of vars over whose domain we have to sum up.

* Algebra.ml(i) renamed into Calculus.ml(i)

* Implemented Calculus.safe_vars

* Cleaned up MixedHyperGraph and moved it to Util

2009-Oct-23:
* Added externals to terms.

* Implemented function bigsum_rewriting.

* Simplified signatures in Compiler.ml.

* Integrated bigsum_rewriting into compile.

2009-Oct-25:
* Generalized delta to support arbritrary terms and formulas. No magic here,
  in the case I was previously excluding, the delta is structurally not
  simpler than the input, so if we would recursively compile, we would not
  terminate.

* Added three more bigsum_rewriting methods.

* Implemented rudimentary transformation to relational algebra, with
  extraction of explicit constraints.
