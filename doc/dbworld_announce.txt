The DBToaster team is pleased to announce the open beta of the DBToaster embedded database compiler.  The DBToaster compiler is available for download at http://www.dbtoaster.org 

The DBToaster compiler generates self-contained database engines that can be easily embedded into user applications.  By analyzing the query workload of each individual user application, DBToaster can produce engines custom-tailored to the application's specific data processing needs.  Database engines produced by DBToaster keep results for the application's query workload fresh and ready for consumption, even if the underlying data is changing rapidly.  For applications like algorithmic trading and live data-warehousing, where low-latency responses to rapidly changing data are critical, our experiments show a common-case performance improvement of 3-4 orders of magnitude over existing systems.  

At the heart of the DBToaster compiler is an extreme form of incremental view maintenance that we call the viewlet transform.  Applying the viewlet transform to a query produces a hierarchy of higher order delta views, each of which dramatically reduces the cost of maintaining its parent in the hierarchy.  In addition to viewlet transform, DBToaster employs a broad range of programming language and compiler techniques to generate extremely efficient code.  For more information on the viewlet transform, see our upcoming paper "DBToaster: Higher-order Delta Processing for Dynamic, Frequently Fresh Views" in VLDB 2012.

DBToaster was developed by a team of researchers from EPFL Switzerland and Johns Hopkins University
