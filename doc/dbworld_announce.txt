The DBToaster team is pleased to announce the open beta of the DBToaster embedded database compiler, now available for download at http://www.dbtoaster.org 

The DBToaster compiler generates self-contained database engines that can be easily embedded into user applications.  By analyzing the query workload of each individual user application, DBToaster can produce engines custom-tailored to the application's specific data processing needs.  For applications like algorithmic trading or live datawarehousing, where a low-latency response to rapidly changing data is critical, our experiments show a common-case performance improvement of 3-4 orders of magnitude over existing systems.  

At the heart of the DBToaster compiler is an extreme form of incremental view maintenance that we call the viewlet transform.  Applying the viewlet transform to a query produces a hierarchy of higher order delta views, each of which dramatically reduces the cost of maintaining its parent in the hierarchy.  Together with a number of programming language and compiler techniques, database engines produced by DBToaster keep results for the application's query workload fresh and ready for consumption, even as the underlying data changes.  For more information, see our upcoming paper in VLDB 2012.

DBToaster was developed by a team of researchers from EPFL Switzerland, Johns Hopkins, and the University at Buffalo.
