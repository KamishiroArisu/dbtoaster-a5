==== Release of DBToaster 2 (rev. 3263) ====

The DBToaster team is excited to announce the release of the second version of the DBToaster SQL query compiler. DBToaster can be downloaded at

http://www.dbtoaster.org


DBToaster is an easy to use SQL to native code compiler.
Code generated by the DBToaster compiler (in the form of C++ or Scala source, a linkable binary, or a JVM .jar) can be easily embedded into user applications.

DBToaster constitutes a quantum leap in database technology, achieving seemingly impossible performance figures.  At the heart of the DBToaster compiler is a transform that turns SQL queries into code that performs an extremely aggressive form of incremental view maintenance.  Code generated from SQL queries by DBToaster is usually 1000 to 10000 times faster at keeping views fresh than state-of-the-art database and data stream processing systems.

The new release features a completely rewritten compiler backend that produces
code that usually outperforms the previous release by 10x or more. Go to
