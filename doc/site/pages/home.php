<p>DBToaster is an SQL-to-native-code compiler. It generates lightweight, specialized, embeddable query engines for applications that require real-time, low-latency data processing and monitoring capabilities.
The DBToaster compiler generates code that can be easily incorporated into any C++ or JVM-based (Java, Scala, ...) project.
</p>

<p>Since 2009, DBToaster has spearheaded the currently ongoing database compilers revolution.
If you are looking for the fastest possible execution of continuous analytical queries, DBToaster is the answer.
DBToaster is
