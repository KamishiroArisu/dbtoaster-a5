\section{Running the project}

The different components of the project and what they can do as of now have
been explained in the Documentation.pdf. This document assumes that points
mentioned in that document are clear before proceeding with this one. There
are many scenarios one may want to test, and how to test may not have been
clear from the documentation. This document is to clear that. The following
are the scenarios that have been tested, and the method to do the same has
been mentioned.
\begin{description}
  \item[The Stock Market Server]
  Command:{\hspace*{\fill}}{\hspace*{\fill}}{\hspace*{\fill}}{\hspace*{\fill}}{\hspace*{\fill}}{\hspace*{\fill}}{\hspace*{\fill}}{\hspace*{\fill}}{\hspace*{\fill}}{\hspace*{\fill}}{\hspace*{\fill}}{\hspace*{\fill}}{\hspace*{\fill}}{\hspace*{\fill}}
  \ \ \tmtexttt{java -cp StockExchangeSimOpt.jar
  stockexchangesim.StockMarketServer <port>}. Here port is the command line
  argument. If left empty, the market is hosted at a default port of 8080.
  
  \item[The BasicSobiTrader] There is a class for implementing a
  BasicSobiTrader. It can be run with the command: \tmtexttt{java -cp
  StockExchangeSimOpt.jar algotraders.basicsobitrader.BasicSobiTrader <param>
  <volToTrade> <margin>}. The purpose of the parameters in clarified in the
  code. The default values are 10.0, 100, 1.0.
  
  \item[ProfitTrader] This was an extension to BasicSobiTrader to give meaning
  to portfolio management. It however has no algorithm for generating trades,
  hence the command line arguments to it specified in the code are meaningless
  till the algorithm is implemented. For now it trades in the market by the
  user typing in commands from the command line.
  Command:\tmtexttt{\tmtexttt{java -cp StockExchangeSimOpt.jar
  algotraders.profitbasedtrader.ProfitTrader}}.
  
  \item[HistoricTrader] This program is to simulate history. To sync historic
  timestamps with current timestamps, uncomment the while loop for syncing in
  the code and rebuild the project. Command: \tmtexttt{java -cp
  StockExchangeSimOpt.jar algotraders.HistoricTrader}
  
  \item[MarketMaker] Used to create the market maker. Command: \tmtexttt{java
  -cp StockExchangeSimOpt.jar nasdaq.MarkerMaker <spread> <maxVolTradeable>
  <windowLength> <stock>}. Default values are 0.1, 1000, 1000, 10101.
  
  \item[Broker] This framework is still incomplete hence its main has not
  been defined.
